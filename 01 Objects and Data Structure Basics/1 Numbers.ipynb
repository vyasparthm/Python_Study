    "Integers are just whole numbers, positive or negative. For example: 2 and -2 are examples of integers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Floating point numbers in Python are notable because they have a decimal point in them, or use an exponential (e) to define the number. For example 2.0 and -2.1 are examples of floating point numbers. 4E2 (4 times 10 to the power of 2) is also an example of a floating point number in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout this course we will be mainly working with integers or simple float number types.\n",
