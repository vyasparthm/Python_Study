    "The <code>while</code> statement in Python is one of most general ways to perform iteration. A <code>while</code> statement will repeatedly execute a single statement or group of statements as long as the condition is true. The reason it is called a 'loop' is because the code statements are looped through over and over again until the condition is no longer met.\n",
